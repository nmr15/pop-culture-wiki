              Jeff attends an accounting class taught by <Link>Professor Whitman</Link> which is less about learning and more about the philosophy
              of "seizing the day". Over in <Link>the study room</Link>, the <Link>group</Link> is irritated at
              <Link to="/community/pierce_hawthorne"> Pierce</Link> who cannot operate his cell phone. Jeff then arrives excited about the blow off
              class he just found and suggests the group sign up too. <Link to="/community/abed_nadir">Abed</Link> declines, explaining that his dad
              forbids him taking any class that won't help him run the family falafel business. <Link to="/community/britta_perry">Britta</Link>
              decides to give Abed the money to pay for a film class he actually wants to take. He suggests that they all get back to studying but is
              subsequently distracted by <Link to="/community/troy_barnes">Troy</Link>'s funny sneeze.

              The study group, minus Britta and Abed, join Jeff for Professor Whitman's accounting course the following day. After
              <Link to="/community/shirley_bennett"> Shirley</Link> introduces herself to the class, Whitman encourages her to have an emotional
              breakthrough regarding her husband. He then commands Annie along with the rest of the students to stand on their desks. After one of the
              students gets injured when her desk collapses, Whitman gives out their homework assignments and dismisses them. He asks that Jeff stay behind
              and hells him he believes his motivations for taking the class are insincere. If by the end of the week he doesn't try to genuinely "live in
              the moment" and "seize the day", Whitman will fail him. Later, Jeff is complaining to Britta about Whitman's ultimatum.

              She asks him how his class is going, and he mentions that he is working on a documentary. It is then that <Link>Abed's father</Link> shows
              up and confronts Britta. He tells her that he is responsible for Abed and doesn't need her help raising him. The two begin to argue, and
              when it becomes physical, Jeff steps in to separate them. Jeff tells Mr. Nadir that Abed is an adult now and can make his own decisions.
              Fed up with the situation, Abed's father respons that Abed is their responsibility now and leaves the campus. The next day in the
              <Link> cafeteria</Link>, Britta runs into Jeff who is dressed in a ridicoulous outfit and waiting for Whitman to arrive for his morning
              coffee.

              Britta has accepted the role of Abed's provider and is trying to calculate his expenses for the semester. Abed arrives with an expensive
              new camera bought with Britta's money. He continues to film his documentary, casting Jeff and Britta in the roles of his parents. Distracted
              by Abed's wasteful spending. Jeff fails to notice Whitman's arrival. The professor disapproves of Jeff's outfit before ordering a birthday
              cake from the <Link>Hot & Brown</Link> coffee shop. Meanwhile, in the <Link>student lounge</Link>, Pierce offers to teach Troy how to sneeze
              strongly and with intent. Elsewhere, Jeff concots a more elaborate scheme to impress Whitman.

              Jeff lies in wait for Whitman to appear in the campus courtyard and launches his plan. Whitman witnesses the entire charade and gives it a
              disapproving thumbs down. He tells Jeff to sincerely try to seize the day, or he will not only fail the class but life as well. Overhearing
              their conversation as she approaches, Britta arrives and gets a flower from Whitman before he leaves. She asks Jeff to talk to Abed about
              his behavior as she just learned he hasn't been attending the film class she paid for. She pleads with Jeff to talk to Abed since he
              refuses to talk to her. It is then that they both notice Abed filming them for his documentary.

              recent be havior. When Jeff confronts Abed about cutting class, he replies that working on his movie project is much more important. When a
              delivery man arrives with lattes, paid for by Britta's money, she immediately loses her cool. She starts to get hysterical and demands that
              Abed explain himself. Abed refuses to give her any answers and instead suggests to her that this is the scene where she leaves. After Britta
              leaves upset, Abed turns to Jeff for his reaction. He calls Abed weird before leaving as well.

              The following day, Jeff tricks both Britta and Abed's father to come to the study room. Abed is there as well, editing his movie on the computer.
              Jeff gathered them all for a meeting to hopefully resolve the situation. However, Jeff's efforts are futile as things become heated again
              between Britta and Abed's dad. Abed cuts through all the arguing with an announcment that his project is finished. He gets the other three to
              sit down and watch his film "<Link>Six Candles</Link>". Britta and Jeff are unsure what they are watching and are surprised to see the movie
              upsets Abed's father, who is crying. He tells Abed that he never blamed him for what happened to his marriage.

              Abed's father turns to Britta and Jeff and says that if filmmaking is a way for Abed to express himself and be understood, then he will pay for
              the classes. After he leaves, Britta realizes that Abed planned this all along and tells him it was a poor way to treat his friend but Abed is
              unapologetic. Meanwhile, Pierce and Troy are walking behind Shirley, and Troy tests his new sneeze, leaving Shirley impressed. Later, outside the
              <Link> library</Link>, Britta is bothered by the fact that she's now in Jeff's debt. She asks Jeff to kiss her, and he eagerly complies. When the
              kiss ends, Professor Whitman shouts out his approval of Jeff seizing the day. Britta tells Jeff that they are now even and walks off. Whitman
              further congratulates Jeff and tells him that the kiss just earned him a passing grade in his class.
