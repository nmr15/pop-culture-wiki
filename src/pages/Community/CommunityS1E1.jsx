          Pilot is the first episode of the first season of the NBC sitcom <a href="#">Community</a>. It aired in the United
          States on September 17, 2009. Written by <a href="#">Dan Harmon</a>, the show's creator, the episode was directed
          by <a href="#">Anthony Russon and Joe Russo</a>. The episode introduces <a href="#">Jeffrey Winger</a> 
          (<a href="">Joel McHale</a>), a disbarred lawyer who is forced to attend community college to get his license back.
          He tries to expolit his friendship with one of the faculty members for easy credits, but fails, and is forced to
          join a Spanish study group. The members of the study group make up the main cast of the series.

          The show takes place at the fictional Greendal Community College in Greendale, Colorado. Harmon based the show on
          his own experiences in community college and partly modeled the character of Jeff Winger on himself. He emphasized
          the cast's importance to the show and also credited some of the actors for their improvisational skills. The episode
          attracted generally favorable reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, which praised both the actors and the comedy writing.
          The show received good viewership and stood out in NBC's Thursday lineup, where the network's other shows suffered
          declines in ratings.

        <h2 className="article-heading" id="1">Plot</h2>
        <p>
          Jeff Winger, a lawyer disbarred for having falsified his degree, has enrolled at Greendale Community College as a
          condition for getting his license back. His plan is to use his friendship with <a href="#">Dr. Ian Duncan</a>, a
          professor at the college and Jeff's client, to obtain test answers. In the cafeteria, Jeff meets the attractive
          <a href="#">Britta Perry</a> (<a href="">Gillian Jacobs</a>) and, in an attempt to get closer to her, convinces
          her to join his non-existent Spanish study group. As the study group convenes, Jeff pretends the other members
          simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited <a href="#">Abed Nadir</a> (<a href="">Danny Pudi</a>) to
          join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave and then gets called to the football field by Duncan, who
          makes a futile attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience and eventually agrees to provide the answers. Jeff returns
          to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited <a href="#">Troy</a> (<a href="#">Donald Glover</a>),
          <a href="#">Shirley</a> (<a href="#">Yvette Nicole Brown</a>), <a href="#">Pierce</a> (<a href="#">Chevy 
          Chase</a>), and <a href="#">Annie</a> (<a href="#">Alison Brie</a>). Finding Britta smoking a cigarette outside,
          he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeff, eager to get away, deliberately stirs up a fight among the group then leaves once more to get the test
          answers. Duncan hands him a sealed envelope, but only in return for Jeff's Lexus. When Jeff returns, the group
          is in turmoil, and Britta promises to go out with him if he can restore order. He does this through an
          inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about
          everything, adding that since he now has the test answers, he does not need the study group. As the group turns
          against him, he leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaving the building, Jeff finds all the pages in the envelope to be blank. He returns to the office of Duncan,
          who tells him that he wanted to teach him a lesson, although Jeff gets his car keys back. As he is about to leave
          campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy and shows his ability to make people feel better about themselves through
          advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test
          answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite
          him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast
          Club had been repeated references throughot the episode.

        <ul>
          <li>Catchprases: Several of the study group's signature catchphrases are introduced in this episode:
            <ul>
              <li>"Cool. Cool, cool, cool." - Abed</li>
              <li>"That's nice." - Shirley</li>
              <li>"You just wrinkled my brain." - Troy</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Discontinuity:
            <ul>
              <li>
                In this episode, it is stated that Jeff has to replace his Bachelor's degree to practice law again.
                However, in the season four finale "<a href="#">Advanced Introduction to Finality</a>, he graduates with an
                Associate's degree in education instead.
              </li>
              <li>
                In this episode, <a href="#">the study room</a> is shown to be upstairs, as Jeff is seen going up a staircase
                to reach it. For the rest of the series onwards, it is ground level.
              </li>
              <li>
                Annie mentions that Troy dislocated both his shoulders during a keg-flip injury, with Troy revealing in
                "<a href="#">Football, Feminism, and You</a>" that he had intentionally injured himself. However, a flashback
                to the incident is shown in the season four episode "<a href="#">Heroic Origins</a>", when Troy is seen faking
                his injury rather than suffering a real one, as well as it being a knee injury as opposed to his shoulders.
              </li>
              <li>
                Abed is the first one to point out that Britta looks like actress Elisabeth Shue. In later episodes, he states
                he is face-blind and is unable to recognize specific features.
              </li>
            </ul>

            History lesson: A brief synopsis of all the main characters' pasts before they came to Greendale is given and why
            they are there now:
            <ul>
              <li>
                While talking with Jeff, Abed goes into great detail about his life, including hints that he may suffer from a
                mental disorder. He further hints at being a lonely person, positively replying to Jeff's dismissive remark
                about "seeing his value now" and rejoicing when he receives a text message for the first time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Jeff tells Professor Duncan that his law credentials were falsified, he was disbarred and now needs to earn a
                legitimate degree at Greendale.
              </li>
              <li>
                Britta's biography is recounted by Abed, who informs Jeff that she has brothers, is 28, and her birthday is in
                October. She herself tells more of her life story to Jeff when they meet in the study room later on.
              </li>
