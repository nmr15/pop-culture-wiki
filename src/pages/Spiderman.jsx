          <p><b>Spider-Man</b> is a superhero in American comic books published by <a href="#">Marvel Comics</a>.
            Created by writer-editor <a href="#">Stan Lee</a> and artist <a href="#">Steve Ditko</a>, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the <a href="#">Silver Age of Comic Books</a>. He has been featured in <a href="#">comic books</a>, <a href="#">television shows</a>, <a href="#">films</a>, <a href="#">video games</a>, <a href="#">novels, and plays</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spider-Man's secret identity is <b>Peter Benjamin Parker</b>. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school student and
            an orphan raised by his <a href="#">Aunt May</a> and <a href="#">Uncle Ben</a> in <a href="#">New York City</a> after his parents,
            <a href="#">Richard and Mary Parker</a>, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with the
            struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many <a href="#">supporting characters</a>, such as
            <a href="#">Flash Thompson</a>, <a href="#">J. Jonah Jameson</a>, and <a href="#">Harry Osborn</a>;
            romantic interests <a href="#">Gwen Stacy</a>, <a href="#">Mary Jane Watson</a>, and the <a href="#">Black Cat</a>;
            and <a href="#">enemies</a> such as <a href="#">Doctor Octopus</a>, the <a href="#">Green Goblin</a>, and <a href="#">Venom</a>.
            In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These
            powers include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings
            like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "<a href="#">web-shooter</a>"
            devices that shoot articial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker
            initially used his powers for his personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his
            powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.

            When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the portagonist's sidekick role.
            The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from the Queens borough of New York City, as Spider-Man's
            secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate. While Spider-Man
            was a quintessential sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes <a href="#">Bucky Barnes</a> and <a href="#">Robin</a>, Spider-Man had no superhero
            mentor like <a href="#">Captain America</a> and <a href="#">Batman</a>; he had learned the lesson for himself that "with great poewr comes great
            responsibility" --a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story, but later retroactively attributed to the
            late Uncle Ben.

            Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several <a href="#">comic book series</a>, the first and longest-lasting of which is <a href="#">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>.
            Since his introducion, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school student to attending college to currently being somewhere in
            his late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous superhero teams, most notably the <a href="#">Avengers</a> and <a href="#">Fantastic Four</a>. Doctor Octopus
            also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012-2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die. Marvel has also published comic books
            featuring the adventres of <a href="#">Miguel O'Hara</a>, the Spider-Man of the future; <a href="#">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>, which features the adventures of
            a teenage <a href="#">Peter Parker</a> in <a href="#">an alternate universe</a>; and <a href="#">Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man</a>, which depicts a teenager named
            <a href="#">Miles Morales</a> who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in his own
            right and was brought into mainstream continuity during the Secret Wars event, where he sometimes works alongside the mainline version of Peter.
