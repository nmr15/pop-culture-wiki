            Harmon based Community on his experiences attending Glendale Community College.
            Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's "story circle" template, a
            method designed to create effective and structured storytelling. Harmon was the
            showrunner for the first three seasons byt was fired before the fourth and replaced by
            David Guarascio and Moses Port. After weaker reviews, Harmon was rehired for the
            fifth season, after which NBC canceled the series. Yahoo! Screen revived the show for
            Community's sixth and final season.
          </p>

            Despite sturggling in the ratings, Community developed a cult following and received
            acclaim for its acting, direction, writing, and meta-humor. It won a Primetime Emmy
            Award from four nominations and received the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best
            Comedy Series in 2012, among other accolades. In September 2022, after several
            years of speculation and development, a featre-length Community film was announced
            for NBCUniversal's streaming service <a href="#">Peacock</a>

          <p>
            <a href="#">Jeff Winger</a> is disbarred and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered he lied
            that he lied about having a bachelor's degree from Columbia University. To earn a legitimate
            degree, he enrolls in Greendale Community College in Colorado. He quickly becomes attracted
            to his classmate, social activist <a href="#">Britta Perry</a>, and pretends to run a study group
            in order to spend time with her. Britta invites classmate <a href="#">Abed Nadir</a>,
            a socially awkward and pop culture obsessed student, who in turn brings other classmates along;
            religious single mother <a href="#">Shirley Bennett</a>; naive over-achiever
            <a href="#">Annie Edison</a>; former high school football star <a href="#">Troy Barnes</a>;
            and bigoted, elderly millionair <a href="#">Pierce Hawthorne</a>. Despite their differences, 
            the group's members soon become close friends. They are often roped into helping the college's
            flamboyant dean, <a href="@">Craig Pelton</a>, in his schemes to make the school seem more
            respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their mentally unstable teacher
            (and eventual classmate and friend) <a href="#">Ben Chang</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Season 1 follows Jeff's creation of the study group and its subsequent misadventures. Season 2
            sees Chang forced to enroll as a student and attempt to join the study group despite secretly
            planning revenge against it, while Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against
            the dean of a rival school, City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle.
            Season 3 focuses on Chang's villanous plot to take over the school, as well as Troy's struggle
            with whether or not to attend the cult-like air conditioning repair school. Season 4 shows the
            study group in its senior year, with all the characters (especially Abed) struggling with what
            may be their final moments together, and Chang recovering from "Changnesia" (a fake amnesia
            which Chang uses as a coverup). Season 5 sees Pierce's death and Troy leaving in the middle of
            the season, while the other characters return to Greendale after graduation to save the school,
            leading Jeff to take a job there as a teacher. Season ends the series with the characters reflecting
            on the last six years while new staff member Frankie Dart arrives at the dysfunctional school
            to make it more respectable, forcing the group to question how much Greendale can be cleaned up while
            still remianing Greendale.

          <h2 className="article__heading" id="2">Cast and characters</h2>
          <p>
            The show features an ensemble cast of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a
            recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the school's dean.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Joel McHale</a> as <a href="#">Jeff Winger</a>, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after
              being suspended by the state bar for falsely claiming to have a bachelor's degreen from Columbia University.
              Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident lothario who often manipulates people to get what he wants.
              He first created the study group in an attempt to get with Britta, a girl in his Spanish class, through
              the ruse of being a Spanish tutor who could help Britta pass the course. As he becomes closer to his
              new study group, his old habits and views change. Most of the group (except Britta, who see through his
              facade) tends to idolize Jeff for his charisma (particularly in the first season), and often seek advice
              from him. Although he initially fits his role as the group's straight man, appearing indifference to their
              concerns before grudgingly helping them, Jeff becomes more willing to make personal sacrifices for his
              friends over time and slowly reveals that he has a great deal of care and reverence for his study group.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Gillian Jacobs</a> as <a href="#">Britta Perry</a>, an anarchist, athiest, and activist who traveled
              around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta tries to be productive, intelligent, and mature, but
              often comes off as pretentious and hypocritical. She has a tendency to lack direction and make things go wrong.
              Despite not being as wordly or well-informed an activist as she thinks, Britta has a genuine desire to help
              others, and she cares deeply for her friends.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Danny Pudi</a> as <a href="#">Abed Nadir</a>, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent,
              with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via conventional
              means due to his autism, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film
              and TV cliches. Despite being out of touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and
              often the wisest member of the group. These eccentricities allow him to pick up on flaws the other characters
              have and tend to bluntly point them out, eventually resulting in the characters learning from his insights.
              Harmon based the character on Abed Gheith, whome he met through Channel 101.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Yvette Nicole Brown</a> as <a href="#">Shirley Bennett</a> (seasons 1-5; guest season 6), a divorced
              mother and vocal Christian going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is a kind-hearted person with strong
              morals, but can be overbearing and often resorts to using guilt to get what she wants or to control her friends'
              behavior. Though usually soft-spoken, Shirley has a quick temper, a characteristic that manifests when she is
              advocating for herself or her friends. It is often implied that Shirley's Christian beliefs, which she tends to
              impose on most non-Christians around her, are a means of coping with her anger issues and repressing the stress she
              deals with in raising her family while also in school.
            </li>
             <li>
              <a href="#">Alison Brie</a> as <a href="#">Annie Edison</a>, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever,
              relentlessly organized and comparatively innocent. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted
              to Adderall, which has caused her to be very anxious and desperate to prove herself to others. Though normally kind-hearted,
              she can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve her goals or is denied something she
              strongly cares about. Her friendship with the study group, as well as her living situation with Troy and Abed, slowly
              allows her to become more laid-back and genial.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Donald Glover</a> as <a href="#">Troy Barnes</a> (seasons 1-5), a former high school star quarterback who
              lost his scholarh=ship to a top-tier university when he dislocated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he did on purpose
              in order to escape pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy begins the series trying to appear cool, acting like
              a stereotypical football player, but he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his nerdy and carefree side, particularly
              thanks to his becoming best friends with Abed. Troy struggles with the idea of growing up, often looking to Jeff and Pierce
              for guidance. Still, he often shows signs of being capable of leadership and bringing the group together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Chevy Chase</a> as <a href="#">Pierce Hawthorne</a> (seasons 1-4; guest season 5), a millionaire and CEO of the
              Hawthorne Wipes moist towelette company who enrolled in Greendale a decade prior to the start of the series for the sake of
              keeping his mind active. More than anyone else within the study group, Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the group
              because of his arrogance, lack of empathy, and casual ignorance of politically correct behavior, all of which largely stern
              from his old age and his emotionally abusive father. This includes believing Britta is a closeted lesbian, lusting over Shirley,
              and casual racism. He also tends to envy the other group members, particularly Jeff's relative youthful attractiveness and
              Abed's close friendship with Troy. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with
              the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, showing that he does care greatly for each of the group members.
