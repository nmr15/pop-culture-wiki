            Harmon based Community on his experiences attending Glendale Community College.
            Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's "story circle" template, a
            method designed to create effective and structured storytelling. Harmon was the
            showrunner for the first three seasons byt was fired before the fourth and replaced by
            David Guarascio and Moses Port. After weaker reviews, Harmon was rehired for the
            fifth season, after which NBC canceled the series. Yahoo! Screen revived the show for
            Community's sixth and final season.
