            Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the <Link to="/marvelcomics">Marvel Comics</Link> character <Link>of the same name</Link>.
            Produced by <Link>Marvel Studios</Link> and distributed by <Link>Paramount Pictures</Link>, it is the first film in the <Link to="/mcu">Marvel Cinematic Universe</Link> (MCU).
            Directed by <Link>Jon Favreau</Link> from a screenplay by the writing team of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film
            stars <Link>Roberty Downey Jr.</Link> as <Link to="/mcu/tony_stark">Tony Stark / Iron Man</Link> alongside Terrence Howard, <Link>Jeff Bridges</Link>, <Link>Gwyneth Paltrow</Link>,
            <Link> Leslie Bibb</Link>, and <Link>Shaun Toub</Link>. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group, world-famous industrialist
            and master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanical suit of armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man.
          </p>
          <p>
            A film featuring Iron Man was in development at <Link>Universal Pictures</Link>, <Link>20th Century Fox</Link>, and <Link>New Line Cinema</Link> at various
            times since 1990 before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2005. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount
            Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006 and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was
            signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differenetiaite the film from numerous other superhero stories that
            are set in New York. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and
            metal versions of the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in <Link>Phase One</Link> of the MCU. It
            grossed over $585 million, becoming the eigth-highest grossing film of 2008, and received praise from critics, especially for Downey's performance as well as
            Favreau's direction, the visual effects, action sequences, and writing. The American Film Insitute selcted it as one of the ten best films of 2008. It received
            two nominations at the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. In 2022, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation
            in the United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Two sequels have been released:
            <Link to="/mcu/iron_man_2"> Iron Man 2</Link> (2010), and <Link to="/mcu/iron_man_3">Iron Man 3</Link> (2013).

            <p>
              <Link to="/mcu/tony_stark">Tony Stark</Link>, who has inherited the defense contractor <Link>Stark Industries</Link> from his late father <Link>Howard Stark</Link>, tours in
              war-torn Afghanistan with his best friend and military liasion, <Link to="/mcu/james_rhodes">James "Rhodey" Rhodes</Link>, to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the
              demonstration, his convoy is ambushed by a terrorist group, the <Link>Ten Rings</Link>, and Stark is gravely wounded by a missile used by the attackers,
              one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by the Ten Rings. <Link>Yinsen</Link>, a fellow captive and doctor, implants an
              electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader <Link>Raza</Link>,
              offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an <Link>arc reactor</Link> to power Stark's electromagnet and construct a
              prototype armored suit to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden, the Ten Rings discover their intentions and attack the workshop.
              Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then
              burns the Ten Rings' weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and
              announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. <Link>Obadiah Stane</Link>, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises
              Stark that this will bankrupt Stark Industries and ruin his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of
              his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest after testing a prototype. Personal assistant
              <Link> Pepper Potts</Link> places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep
              his work to himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              At a charity event, reporter <Link>Christine Everhart</Link> informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are
              being used to attack Yinsen's home village. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he fends off the terrorists and saves the villagers.
              While flying home, Stark is intercepted by the Air Force. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten
              Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been trafficking arms to the Ten Rings and has staged a coup to replace
              Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has him and the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive
              new armor suit reverse-engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She
              discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group altered their plans when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons.
              Potts meets with Agent <Link to="/mcu/phil_coulson">Phil Coulson</Link> of <Link>S.H.I.E.L.D.</Link>, an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stane's scientists are unable to replicate Stark's miniature arc reactor, so Stane enters Stark's home, stuns him, and steals the one from his chest.
              Stark manages to replace it with his original reactor. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and overpowers
              them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the
              Stark Industries building, where Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge
              that causes Stane to fall into the reactor and he is killed in the explosion. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being the
              superhero the press has dubbed "Iron Man".
            </p>
            <p>
              In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. director <Link to="/mcu/nick_fury">Nick Fury</Link> visits Stark at his home, telling him he has become part of a
              "bigger universe", and that he wants to discuss the "<Link>Avengers Initiative</Link>".

              <li>
                <Link>Robert Downey Jr.</Link> as <Link to="/mcu/tony_stark">Tony Stark / Iron Man</Link>:<br />
                An industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military. Director Jon
                Favreau felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part and that the actor could not only make Stark a "likeable asshole."
                but also portray an authentic emotional journey, one he had won over the audience. Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance
                in <Link>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</Link>. Downey frequently spoke with the film's director, <Link>Shane Black</Link>, about the script and dialogue in
                Iron Man. Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process, especially
                when it came to adding humor to the film. Downey explained, "What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you
                were digging turns into Dudley Do-Right, and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That Eliot Ness-in-a-cape-type thing.
                What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not
                anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor." To get into shape, Downey spent five days a week weight training and practiced martial arts,
                which he said benefited him because "it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ...after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up
                every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get them through the day."
              </li>
              <li>
                <Link>Terrence Howard</Link> as <Link to="/mcu/james_rhodes">James "Rhodey" Rhodes</Link>:<br />
                A friend of Stark's and the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Air Force in the department of acquisitions, specifically
                weapons development. Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play War Machine in a sequel. Howard prepared for the role by visiting Nellis
                Air Force Base on March 16, 2007, where he ate with the pilots and observed HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopters and F-22 Raptors. While Rhodes is
                roguish in the comics after he meets Stark, his previous role as a disciplinarian creates a dynamic tension with Stark's character. He is unsure
                whether Stark's actions are acceptable, "Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life, but at a certain point he realizes
                that perhaps there is a different way," Howard said. "Whose life is the right way: Is it the strict military life, or the life of an independent?"
                Howard and his father are Iron Man fans, partly because Thodes was one of the few black superheroes when Howard was a child. Howard admired
                Downey as an actor since the latter appeared in Weird Science (1985); the two completed physically on set. Howard signed a three-picure deal
                with Marvel Studios.

              <li>
                <Link>Gwyneth Paltrow</Link> as <Link>Virgina "Pepper" Potts</Link>:<br />
                Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest. Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her
                understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, level-headed, and grounded. She said she like "the fact that there's a
                sexuality that's not blatant." Favreau wanted Potts' and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy, something which Paltrow
                considered to be fun in an "innocent yet sexy" way.

              director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene. Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the <Link>Ultimate Marvel</Link> imprint
              <Link>version of Nick Fury</Link>. Other cameos in the film include <Link>Stan Lee</Link> as himself, being mistaken for Hugh Hefner by Stark

              the film, as a terrorist guard; and Jim Cramer as himself. Ghostface Killah, who often adopted Iron Man's name as an alias, had a cameo in a

            <h3 className="article-heading-3" id="3.1">Development</h3>
            <p>
              In April 1990, Universal Pictures bought the rights to develop Iron Man for the big screen, with Stuart Gordon to direct a low-budget film based
              on the property. By February 1996, 20th Century Fox had acquired the rights from Universal. In January 1997, <Link to="#">Nicolas Cage</Link> expressed 
              interest in portraying the character, while in September 1998, <Link to="#">Tom Cruise</Link> expressed interest in producing as well as starring
              in an Iron Man film. Jeff Vintar and Iron Man co-creator Stan Lee co-wrote a story for Fox, which Vintar adapted into a screenplay. It included a
              new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured <Link to="#">MODOK</Link> as the villain. Tom rothman, President of Production at Fox,
              credited the screenplay with finally making him understand the character. In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script.
              That October, <Link to="#">Quentin Tarantino</Link> was approached to write and direct the film. Fox sold the rights to New Line Cinema the
              following December, reasong that although the Vintar/Lee scripts was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and "we
              can't make them all."
            </p>
            <p>
              By July 2000, the film was being written for New Line Cinema by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Tim McCanlies. McCanlies' script used the idea of
              a Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film. In June 2001, New Line Cinema entered talks with <Link to="#">Joss Whedon</Link>, a fan of the character,
              to direct, and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a completed script. New Line took a "unique" approach to writing the film's script,
              hiring David Hayter, David S. Goyer, and Mark Protosevich to "sit in a room and simply talk on camera about Iron Man for a few days". After this,
              Hayter was hired in 2004 to write the script. He reworked scripts that had been written by Jeff Vintar and Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, which had
              included the villain the <Link to="#">Mandarin</Link> and Pepper Potts as a love interest. Hayter removed the Mandarin and instead chose to pit
              Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine. Hayter said "you want to try to mirror your hero with your villain as much as
              possible" for his reasoning behing making Howard the villain. He also made <Link to="#">Bethany Cabe</Link> the film's love interest over Potts.
              In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release. However, this deal ultimately fell
              through, and the Iron Man film rights return to Marvel.
            </p>
            <p>
              In November 2005, Marvel Studios worked to start development from sratch, and announced Iron Man as their first independent feature, because the
              character was their only major one not already depicted in live action. Paramount Pictures was announced as Marvel's distribution partner for Iron
              Man. According to associate producer Jeremy Latcham, "we went after about 30 writers and they all passed," saying they were uninterested in the
              project due to both the relative obscurity of the character and the fact that it was solely a Marvel production. When the film did have a script,
              even the requests to rewrite met with many refusals. Early scripts for the film also directly referenced Sony Pictures' <Link>Spider-Man 2</Link>
              (2004) by identifying Stark as the creator of <Link>Otto Octavius</Link>'s bionic arms. In order to build the general public's awareness of Iron
              Man and elevate him to the same level of popularity as <Link>Spider-Man</Link> or <Link>Hulk</Link>, Marvel conducted focus groups, trying to find
              a way to remove the general perception that the character is a robot. The information Marvel received from the focus groups was used to formulate
              an awareness-building plan which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release. The shorts were called "Iron Man
              Advertorials", and were produced by <Link>Tim Miller</Link> and Blur Studio.

            <h3 className="article-heading-3" id="3.2">Pre-production</h3>
            <p>
              Jon Favreau was hired to direct the film in April 2006, and he celebrated getting the job by going on a diet, resulting in him losing 70 pounds
              (32 kg). Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer <Link>Avi Arad</Link> on another film after they both worked on <Link>Daredevil</Link>
              (2003). The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious "ultimate spy movie" in Iron Man, citing inspiration from
              <Link> Tom Clancy</Link>, <Link>James Bond</Link>, and <Link>Robocop</Link> (1987), and compared his approach to an independent film, "If
              Robert Altman had directed <Link>Superman</Link>" and <Link>Batman Begins</Link> (2025). Favreau wanted to make Iron Man a story of an adult man
              literally reinventing himself after discovering the world is far more complex than he originally believed. He changed the Vietnam War origin of
              the character to Afghanistan, as he did not to do a period piece. Art Marcum and Matt Holloway were hired to write the script, while Mark Fergus
              and Hawk Ostby wrote another version, with Favreau compiling both teams' scripts, and John August then "polishing" the combined version. Comic

              were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script. In May 2006, Arad left Marvel Studios to become an independent producer. Because
              he was on staff when the deal was made for Iron Man, he retained producer credit on the film. By July 2006, Matthew Libatique was attached to
              serve as cinematographer.

              Favreau planned to cast a newcomer in the title role, as "those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is
              the star. The success of <Link>X-Men</Link> and <Link>Spider-Man</Link> without being star-driven pieces reassures [executives] that the film
              does have an upside commercially." Those considered for the role included Jim Caviezel, <Link>Timothy Olyphant</Link>, <Link>Sam Rockwell</Link>,
              and Clive Owen. Rockwell was approached and was interested, but Favrueau then met with Robert Downey Jr., who he was convinced was the right
              actor for the role. Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part,
              explaining: "The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles
              that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." Favreau faced opposition from Marvel Entertainment executives in casting Downey, but
              would not take no for an answer, saying: "It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ...everybody knew he was
              talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert
              in all the good and bad ways." Casting director <Link>Sarah Hailey Finn</Link> suggested Downey create an audition tape to help persuade them.
              The executives were still not convinced, despite Favreau and Feige recommending Downey for the role, which resulted in Favreau leaking to the
              press that Downey was in talks; the positive reaction and enthusiasm to this story helped convice the executives, and Downey was cast in
              September 2006. Rockewell would later portray <Link>Justin Hammer</Link> in <Link>Iron Man 2</Link> (2010). Downey earned $500,000 for the
              role. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk. Downey said, "Elon was someone Tony probably
              hung out with and partied with, or more likely went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concotions with the shamans."
            </p>
            <p>
              Additional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: Terrence Howard was announced in the rol of Stark's best friend James
              "Rhodey" Rhodes in October 2006. He had been the first actor cast for the film; <Link>Rachel McAdams</Link> was reportedly Favreau's first
              choice for the role of Virgina "Pepper" Potts, but she turned it down to focus on raising her own family. Gwyneth Paltrow was in the role
              instead in January 2007; and Jeff Bridges was in an undisclosed role in February. <Link>Don Cheadle</Link> has also been approached for the
              role of Rhodes, and would eventually replace Howard in the role starting with the sequel, Iron Man 2. Choosing a character to be the villain
              of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave
              his opinion on the script. The Mandarin had originally been envisioned as a rival to Tony Stark with a building of his own right next to
              Stark Industries, with the Mandarin eventually drilling a hole underneath Stark Industries to steal all of Stark's technology for himself;
              associate producer Jeremy Latcham described such story as "crazy terrible" and "underwhelming". Favreau felt only in a sequel, with an
              altered tone, would the fantasy of the <Link>Mandarin's rings</Link> be appropriate. The decision to push him into the background was
              compated to Sauron in The Lord of the Rings, or <Link>Palpatine</Link> in <Link to="/starwars">Star Wars</Link>. Fabreau also wanted Iron
              Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in the role, with Stane originally
              intended to become a villain in the sequel; a version of the script intended to show Stane had escaped his damaged suit. The
              <Link> Crimson Dynamo</Link> was also a villain in early drafts of the script, including at one point combining the character with the
              Mandarin. Favreau felt it was important to include intentional insider references for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter
              jets that attack Iron Man the call sign of "Whiplash 1" and "Whiplash 2", a reference to the comic book villain <Link>Whiplash</Link>,
              and including <Link>Captain America's shield</Link> in Stark's workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
              Favreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages. Stan Winston, a fan of the
              comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on Zathura (2005), built metal and rubber versions of the armor. The Mark I design
              was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark Stark would use his
              resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single 41-kilogram (90 lb) version was built, causing
              concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed.  The armor was also designed to have
              only its top half worn at times. Stan Winston Studios built a 3.0-meter (10 ft), 360-kilogram (800 lb) animatronic version of Iron Monger
              (Obadiah Stane), a name which Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earleier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the
              suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a gimbal to simulate walking. A scale model
              was used for the shots of it being built. The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps. Iron Man comic book artist Adi
              Granov designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders. Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on
              board the film after he recognized his work on Favreau's MySpace page. Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and
              less cartoonish in its proportions, and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was "cut from the script about halfway through
              pre-production". He explained that the War Machine armor "was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out
              parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor", and that it "would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence".

            <h3 className="article-heading-3" id="3.3">Filming</h3>
            <p>
              Production was based in the former Hughes Company soundstage in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, Califronia. Howard Hughes was one of the
              inspiration for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark
              III where the Hughes H-4 Hercules was built. Favreau rejected the East Coast setting of the comic books because many superhero films had
              already been set there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Filimg began on March 12, 2007, with Matthew Libatique serving as director of photography. The first few weeks of filming were spent on
              Stark's captivity in Afghanistan. The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a 150-200 yeard (140-180 m) long set, which had movable forks
              in the caverns to allow great freedom for the film's crew. Production designer J. Michael Riva saw footage of a Taliban fighter in
              Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system
              in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea. Afterwards, Stark's
              capture was filmed at Lone Pine, and other exterior scens in Afghanistan were filmed at Olancha Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two
              days of 40-60-mile-per-hour (64-97 km/h) winds. During three days of filming at the Edwards Air Force Base in mid-April, around 150
              servicemembers were cast as extras. Other producion assitance by the United States Department of Defense included the provision of fabric
              for 100 uniforms, F-22 Raptors, two HH-60 helicopters and parked C-17. In return, the Departmet of Defense consulted on the film regarding
              certain scenes and dialogue depcting the military. This included changing Stark from being opposed to arms deals, to instead becoming one
              who sells his technology to the U.S. military. Exterior shots os Stark's home were digitally added to footage of Point Dume in Malibu,
              while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more "grease
              monkey". Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked,
              "I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs". He hired "people who are good at creating
              action", so "the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre".
            </p>
            <p>
              There was much improvisation in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on
              the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were
              shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to ry something new each time. It
              was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a news conference on the floor, and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the
              Jericho weapon. Downey improvised the film's final line, "I am Iron Man", which Feige felt was in line with the character's personality.
              Bridges described this approach as "a $200 million student film", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars
              were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scens. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap
              characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded. Paltrow was less comfortable with improvisation, so Favreau would take notes
              on things she said during rehearsals or in off-handed moments that were in line with the character to incorporate into Potts' dialogue.
            </p>
            <p>
              The crew conceived a post-credits scene featuring Nick Fury and called Samuel L. Jackson to ask him if he would be interested in playing
              Fury, as Jackson had learned a few years earlier that his likeness had been used for Fury in the Ultimate Marvel comics imprint. However.
              according to Latcham, Jackson originally appeared without any deal for him to reappear in later films: "It was just this weird idea that
              maybe people give a shi-- if we stick it on the end". The fialogue for the scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael
              Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set. It was filmed with
              a skeleton crew in order to keep the cameo a secret, but rumors appeared on the internet only days later. Feige subsequently had the scene
              removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing. An alternate version of the Nick Fury post-credits
              scene was filmed in which he specifically mentions "gamma accidents, radioactive bug bites and assorted mutants", referencing Hulk, 
              Spider-Man, and the X-Men, but this was cut due to Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox holding the respective film rights to Spider-Man and
              the X-Men at the time.

            <p>
              Favreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be
              too obvious. He hired <Link>Industrial Light & Magic</Link> (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing
              Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and Transformers. The Orphanage and The Embassy did additional work, with the latter creating a
              ditial version of the Mark I armor. To help with aniamting the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey
              wear only the helmet, sleeves, and chest of the costume over a motion capture suit, and skydivers were filmed in a vertical wind tunnel to
              study the physics of flying. For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly.
              To generate shots of Iron Man an the F-22 Raptors battling, cmaeras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost
              on the lenses. Favreau conceived of the head-up display shots so audiences would not become disconnected from Stark when watching scenes
              with the CG Iron Man.
            </p>
            <p>
              When editor Dan Lebental started compiling an initial edit of the film in late 2007, it was quickly realized that the final act of the film
              was not working, as it was "basically two robots punching each other". They tried shortening the sequence, which did not help as it became
              "both emotionally unsatisfying and abruptly anticlimactic". Marvel rehired Marcum and Holloway, as all of the screenwriters had been
              relased from their commitments at the end of filming, who suggested the act should call back to earlier in the film when Stark was learning
              that one of the limitations of the suit was it freezing at high altitudes. Favreau was hesitant to commit to this change, as it would cost
              an additional $6 million. However, the impending writers' strike forced him to move forward with this idea, with Marcum and Holloway
              submitting a draft of the ending on November 4, 2007, a day before the strike began. Given no further rewrites could occur because of the
              strike and Bridges was unable to participate in shooting new material, ILM worked with as much previously-shot footage as possible to rework
              the film's ending.

              Composer Ramin Djawadi had been a fan of the character Iron Man as a child, saying that he always like superheroes "that actually don't have
              any superpowers". After Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film, Djawadi sought out the role himself.
              Favreau had a clear vision of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional
              superhero. Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi had help with
              arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions, and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who also
              makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score. The film also features a big band-style arrangement of the
              Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and Rick Boston. A
              soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by Lions Gate Records on April 29, 2008.

              In July 2006, with the film still in pre-production, Favreau and Arad attended <Link>San Diego Comic-Con</Link> to promote the film, where the
              film's armor design, drawn by Adi Granov, was revealed along with the announcement fhat the Mandarin was intended to be the the antagonist of
              the film. The following year, Favreau returned to San Diego Comic-Con to once again promote the film with Downey and Feige, where a teaser
              trailer was shown. With much of the visuals not yet ready, Favreau worked with ILM to have the flying shots ready, saying "I know that I had
              to make a splash because there was zero anticipation for the film at the time".Stan Winston Studios also brought a life-sized replica of the
              film's armor to display at the convention.

              Marvel and Paramount modeled their marketing campaign for Iron Man on that of Transformers. In May 2008, <Link>Sega</Link> released an official
              tie-in <Link>video game based on the film</Link> on multiple gaming platforms. Downey, Howard, and Toub reprise their roles from the film. A
              30-second spot for the film aired during Super Bowl XLII break. <Link>Hasbro</Link> created figures of armor from the film, as well as
              <Link> Titanium Man</Link> (who appears in the video game) and the <Link>armor from the World War Hulk comics</Link>.

              The 7-Eleven convenience store chain helped promote the film across the United States, and LG Group also made a sponsorship deal with Paramount.
              Worldwide, Burger King and Audi promoted the film. Favreau was set to direct a commercial for the fast-food chain, as Transformers director
              <Link> Michael Bay</Link> did for that film. In the film, Tony Stark drives an Audi R8, and also has an "American cheeseburger" from Burger
              King after his rescue from Afghanistan, as part of the studio's product placement deal with the respective companies. Three other vehicles, the
              Audi S5 sports coupe and the Audi Q7 SUV, also appear in the film. Audi created a tie-in website, as General Motors did for Transformers.
              Oracle Corporation also promoted the film on its site. Several <Link>tie-in comics</Link> were released for the film.
