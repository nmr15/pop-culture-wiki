The open refrigerator gives him a bad case of a sickness similar to the common cold called the suds, causing him to sneeze bubbles out of his pores. Unfortunately, Patrick foolishly tells SpongeBob that going to the doctor is a terrifying experience. SpongeBob asks Patrick to cure him, but he only makes it worse. Sandy then takes SpongeBob to a real doctor, who prescribes the \"sponge treatment\", involving SpongeBob being used to clean dishes, a car, a man's back, a human foot, and the floor. The treatment cures SpongeBob completely and he is given a free lollipop. Patrick wants his own lollipop so he fakes having the symptoms of the suds and gets the painful \"starfish treatment\" in which he is used to clean a cactus and a toilet."
