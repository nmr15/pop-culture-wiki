He starts up a Spanish study group in order to score with attractive classmate Britta Perry, who invites her friend Abed Nadir, who in turn invites classmates Troy Barnes, Annie Edison, Shirley Bennett, and Pierce Hawthorne. After believing he has secured a date with Britta, Jeff stirs up conflict within the group in order to leave with her, only to be confronted by her about his ulterior motive. When he gives an inspirational speech to calm them down and finally go out with Britta, she reveals his true intention and asks him to leave. Jeff storms out, only to find out the answers obtained from Duncan are actually blank. As he is leaving campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, who are encouraged by his advice. Jeff resigns himself to flunking the test, but Britta, speaking for the group, reluctantly invites him back, saying the group didn't make much progress after his departure."
